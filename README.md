Service Workers are scripts that your browser runs in the background, separate from a web page. 
Sits between your web app on browser and network.(Acts as proxy servers)
They enable features that donâ€™t need a web page or user interaction, like push notifications and background sync.

Web Push is a technology that allows servers to send messages to web applications, even when the web app is not open in the browser. (Sends via SW)

Web push notifications rely on active service workers to function.

How Web Push Works with Active Service Workers?
1. User Subscription: The user subscribes to push notifications through the browser.
2. Subscription Information: The browser sends the subscription information to the server.
3. Push Message and Push Service: When the server has a message to send, it sends the push message via push service and push service delivers the message to the browser.
4. Service Worker Activation: The browser wakes up the service worker to handle the incoming push message.
5. Notification Display: The service worker processes the message and displays a notification to the user.
